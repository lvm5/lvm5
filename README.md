### LEANDRO VANSAN DE MORAIS

⚡️ **Work:** For the past 16 years, I've been an electrician at Nestlé Brazil, where I've used embedded programming to maintain and upgrade machinery and processes.


🎓 **Education:** As a final year Computer Engineering student, I'm passionate about becoming an iOS developer. I'm actively learning Swift and SwiftUI, and I've already built a few simple apps that I'm continuously improving. I'm eager to learn from the community and open to any suggestions that can accelerate my growth.

👨🏻‍💻 **Dream:** While I understand I'm a beginner, I'm incredibly motivated and a fast learner. I would be eternally grateful for the chance to break into development with my first developer role.
